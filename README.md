# CS372-TDD
TDD practice over spring break

I chose to do the string calculator exercise. I set a 45 minute timer to see how far I'd get along. 

1. An empty string returns zero- DONE!
2. A single number returns the value- DONE!
3. Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum- DONE!
4. Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum- DID NOT FINISH by the time ended
5. Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum
6. Negative numbers throw an exception
7. Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
8. A single char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //# for a ‘#’ as the delimiter)
9. A multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //[###] for ‘###’ as the delimiter)
10. Many single or multi-char delimiters can be defined (each wrapped in square brackets)

Post assignment thoughts:
It took me a little while to figure out how to start it especially the calculator.cpp file. 
I will come back to it and work on finishing it!
